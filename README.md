# Vagrant based okd cluster

Based on Grant Shipleys installcentos script, I have created a Vagrant project to easily power up a 
one node okd cluster.

## Why OKD based

Because if you want to try something more stable and closer to production, it is best to use the offical version of installing OKD.
Documentation on the net then matches also more what you find on your VM.
